### About the project

The purpose of this project is to develop the ultimate SpaceX experience in a variety of platforms. A single experience, from a single codebase.

From the start, SpaceX GO! has been developed to be light-weight, fast and easy to use. It takes all the data from the open-source r/SpaceX REST API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

This project has been built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework, which allows to build an app for mobile, desktop & web, from a single codebase.
